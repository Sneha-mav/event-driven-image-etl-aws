# event-driven-image-etl-aws
A fully serverless, event-driven ETL pipeline that processes images uploaded to S3 and routes notifications through SNS based on image category. The system automatically validates file type, extracts metadata, categorizes images, and writes structured JSON output — all without servers or manual processing.
